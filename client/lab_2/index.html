        <div> 
          <img src="image/mochi.gif" width = '150' alt="A dancing mochi ball">
          <img src="image/mochi.jpg" width = '150' alt="A mochi ball in a bubble">
          <img src="image/mochi.png" width = '150' alt="A mochi ball">
          <img src="image/mochi.svg" width = '75' alt="A mochi ball">
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>These images are of "Mochi Balls".
            The first (left) is a .gif image, which is just a simple animation with little but sufficient detail.
            The second is a .jpg image, which is good for displaying images but can't display transparent pixels.
            The third is a .png image, this image type is good for images that are not photos or animations, like logo.
            The last image is a .svg image, this is a vector file type as opposed to a raster, it is great 
            because the quality is great at any size and the image is not grainy or low quality.</p>

Hook it up to CSS by including style.css in the <head> tag

Then add CSS class names to your HTML to make it look like the lab pictures.
For example: <div class="selector">

You should not need to edit the CSS to do this, only the HTML.

Don't forget to add an actual set of image descriptions to your image carousel.
